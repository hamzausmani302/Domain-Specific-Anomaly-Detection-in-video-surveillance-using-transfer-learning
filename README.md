# Domain Specific anomaly detection in video surveillance using transfer learning


The folliwing program is a domain specific version of anomaly detection.


Download C3D sports-1m weights from [here](https://github.com/adamcasson/c3d/releases/download/v0.1/sports1M_weights_tf.h5) and 
save them to 'trained_models' folder as 'c3d_sports1m.h5'.

Run demo.py to run the code on the demo video in 'input' folder. Visualization of the predictions from the model is saved in 'output' folder.

#### Libraries Used

* Keras : 2.2.0 
* Tensorflow : 1.10.1
* Numpy : 1.14.5
* OpenCV : 3.3.0.10 
* Scipy : 0.19.1
* Matplotlib : 2.0.2



Will add the training code soon...!!
